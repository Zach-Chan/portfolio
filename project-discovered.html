                            Canada and other immigrants grow accustomed to their new surroundings by making it easier
                            to overcome language barriers to increase engagement with their community through public

                        The final result is an interactive wireframe of a mobile application I designed with 3 other
                        team members to help refugees and new immigrants to Canada with adjusting to their new home and
                        engaging with the community to combat the isolation that can often plague immigrants to any new
                        country. Dis&sdot;covered provides information about nearby free community events, immigration
                        and international services offices, conveniently has the ability to swap back and forth between
                        English and other languages to help overcome language barriers.

                        Initially, interest in this project was sparked from the news stories circulating at the time.
                        Research began with developing a full understanding of the domain of settling in a new country.
                        <span id="userResearch" class="highlight-skill">I conducted extensive research to understand
                            the goals and problems of the end users and we captured our findings in a persona and
                            journey map.</span> We identified 2 key areas to help
                        with a new immigrant or refugee's transition into living in Canada: handling the
                        overwhelming number of legal work and becoming familiar with their community to be
                        comfortable going out and making connections with others. As this was an academic project, we
                        choose to design something to solve the latter issue as it seemed more likely to let us design
                        something more visually interesting.

                        One of the more experimental ideas I came up with was to create a long press interaction on the
                        edge of the screen to trigger the language toggle UI and then let users swipe to the left if
                        changing to the English language or to the right if they are switching to Arabic to prime the
                        user's brain for reading the languages in their opposite reading directions. However, this
                        proved to be too difficult to implement with the prototyping software we were using so this idea
                        was left behind.

                        testing as well as experiment with unique, new designs but to also not become too attached to
                        designs so that I can be more dynamic in my process and adapt to meet project requirements and
                        real-world constraints.
