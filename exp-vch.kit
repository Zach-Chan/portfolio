                        GF Strong provides workshops and personalized therapy for people diagnosed with MTBI and
                        strokes. Many people experience MTBI in the form of concussions from recreational activities,
                        car accidents, and work. However, GF Strong’s workshops for concussion are always booked months
                        in advance which puts people who are in need of information and guidance on how to recover
                        waiting unacceptable lengths of time. GF Strong’s services have a huge impact on helping
                        patients get onto the road to recovery and being unable to offer enough services is the number
                        one obstacle they want to overcome.

                        As a web developer in the Learning Technologies team of Vancouver Coastal Health, BC's largest
                        health authority, I work with clinicians, leadership members, and the public to create
                        accessible, intuitive websites and specialized applications that deliver education about medical
                        topics. A black sheep within this government organization, the Learning Technologies team is a
                        small agile team of creatives who specialize in user experience design and web development (like
                        myself) as well as instructional education.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> I deliver user-oriented design using skills including user research, creating user
                            personas, storyboarding, A/B testing, and usability testing.
                        </li>
                        <li>I create effective digital solutions using knowledge gained from conducting competitive
                            analysis, keeping up with industry best practices, and rapidly prototyping with code and
                            wireframes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I design visual icons and graphics and other multimedia.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I self-manage my time across multiple projects with varying deadlines as well as manage the
                            projects themselves, taking ownership of their success or shortcomings.
                        </li>

                            I communicate with clients from start to the finish of projects, working together to unearth
                            goals, measures of success, communicating design decisions, and gaining valuable feedback to
                            iterate on work.

                        The VCH Concussion Guide was my first time building a site as large as this and a great
                        introduction to the highly customizable content management system Craft CMS. I enjoyed working
                        with team members and clients of very diverse backgrounds of expertise and I am proud of how I
                        used my own proficiency in UX and web development to facilitate thorough research, design work,
                        and validation through testing throughout the project timeline. This project was a great
                        exhibition of accessible design in the real world and I loved working in the healthcare industry
                        on a digital tool bringing a positive impact to people in the community.
