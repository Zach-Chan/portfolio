                        In light of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2017, we looked at how to help new immigrants to Canada
                        grow accustomed to their new surroundings by making it easier to overcome language barriers and
                        increase engagement with their community through public events and services.

                        Initially, interest in this project was sparked from the news stories circulating at the time.
                        Research began with developing a full understanding of the domain of settling in a new country.
                        I conducted extensive research to understand the goals and problems of the end users and we
                        captured our findings in a persona and journey map. We identified 2 key areas to help with a new
                        immigrant or refugee's transition into living in Canada: handling the overwhelming amount of
                        legal work they would have to do and becoming familiar with their community to be comfortable
                        going out and making connections with others. As this was an academic project, we chose to
                        design something to solve the issue of integrating into a new community as it seemed more likely
                        to let us design something more visually interesting.

                    <h3>Language Barriers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Making the app comfortable to use despite language barriers was a major area of focus for me. I
                        ideated through sketches to design an onboarding process to select a user's native language and
                        providing clear interface elements to quickly swap between languages to use the app while also
                        learning useful English words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the more experimental ideas I came up with was to create a long press interaction on the
                        edge of the screen to trigger the language toggle UI and then let users swipe to the left if
                        changing to the English language or to the right if they are switching to Arabic to prime the
                        user's brain for reading the languages in their opposite reading directions. However, this
                        proved to be too difficult to implement with the prototyping software we were using so this idea
                        was left behind.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Other Interaction Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the whole design process I ideated and designed interactions like long pressing on
                        event tags to provide translations in bubbles and managing the amount of information presented
                        to users on the map view at different levels of zooming in.

                        We designed initial iterations of the app interface with Adobe Illustrator but completed
                        designing in the UX program Flinto so that we could capture the animated responses we had
                        designed and conduct usability testing with an interactive prototype. I conducted informal speak
                        aloud tests to gain qualitative feedback and find problem areas of the UI.

                        engaging with the community to combat the isolation that can often plague immigrants to any new

                        and

                        and
                        testing as well as experiment with unique, new designs but to also not become too attached to
