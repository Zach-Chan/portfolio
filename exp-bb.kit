                        BlackBerry Ltd. is a Canadian multinational company focused on enhancing security and
                        productivity for customers through business enterprise software and their business in the
                        internet of things. As a part of the Mobility Solutions UX team, I worked on the BlackBerry Hub+
                        mobile apps suite and BlackBerry Secure Android experience.

                        In the mobility solutions team I worked closely with other designers as well as with cross
                        disciplined teams consisting of project managers and developers. I primarily worked on mobile
                        application interfaces but also gained huge amounts of experience conducting user testing,
                        learning how to work within established design languages and learning motion designs.

                        The VCH Concussion Guide was my first time building a site as large as this and a great
                        introduction to the highly customizable content management system Craft CMS. I enjoyed working
                        with team members and clients of very diverse backgrounds of expertise and I am proud of how I
                        used my own proficiency in UX and web development to facilitate thorough research, design work,
                        and validation through testing throughout the project timeline. This project was a great
                        exhibition of accessible design in the real world and I loved working in the healthcare industry
                        on a digital tool bringing a positive impact to people in the community.
