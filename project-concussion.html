                        In a 4 month long project, I co-designed and developed a web tool that helps guide concussion
                        patients and their loved ones with learning about MTBI (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury) and how to
                        manage the recovery process.

                        I was brought on board the project because of my multidisciplinary background as a designer and
                        web developer. In such a small team, this was a huge advantage that helped us adapt to changes
                        in client needs and pivots in direction. As a team, we met with our client: the clinical
                        therapists at GF Strong Hospital in Vancouver BC. We discussed and sketched and created lots of
                        ideas together to refine the direction of the project and get a stronger idea of what the
                        problem area was and what avenues we had available for pursuing solutions.

                        GF Strong provides workshops and personalized therapy for people diagnosed with MTBI and
                        strokes. Many people experience MTBI in the form of concussions from recreational activities,
                        car accidents, and work. However, GF Strong’s workshops for concussion are always booked months
                        in advance which puts people who are in need of information and guidance on how to recover
                        waiting unacceptable lengths of time. GF Strong’s services have a huge impact on helping
                        patients get onto the road to recovery and being unable to offer enough services is the number
                        one obstacle they want to overcome.

                        Dis•Covered was a great opportunity for me to practice user-driven design through research and
                        testing as well as experiment with unique, new designs but to also not become too attached to
                        designs so that I can be more dynamic in my process and adapt to meet project requirements and
                        real-world constraints.
