                        Fit First’s members consists people ranging from young adults who hadn’t run for years to
                        retirees who are marathon veterans. To gain a better understanding of the people in the group
                        and identify an opportunity for a digital solution <span id="userResearch" class="highlight-skill">I
                            conducted interviews with members and
                            observed and participated in group activities to gather information.</span> We found lots
                        of overlap
                        in motivations and pain points along experience-level divisions and the organizers themselves

                    <p>
                        All three of these users’ goals centered around how to motivate themselves (or their members in
                        the case of the organizer) to run more often to keep improving their fitness. The different
                        types of users had pain points like lack of time, self-consciousness about their fitness, and
                        physical pain which kept them from reaching their goals. However they all still beat these
                        hurdles each week because they loved their weekly Sunday runs with the group. We realized our
                        solution would need to capture elements of what they love about the social group runs to
                        motivate members to do additional running outside of that.

                    <h3>Testing Theories</h3>
                    <p>
                        To see if we could encourage members to run more often each week I ran an activity to test if a
                        collaborative running distance goal would affect the amount that members ran on on their own. I
                        designed the goal as a tangible item to see if a physical representation of the goal would help
                        motivate them more than having normal assigned homework runs. I put a paper with a table onto a
                        relay baton for runners to fill in the distances they ran and then physically pass the baton
                        onto their friends in the group to keep adding to the goal. On post-activity interviews, three
                        more members who normally don’t complete homework runs achieved them and attributed the baton
                        to helping keep them more motivated. This guided us to our final solution of creating a digital
                        interface to help members continue to interact with each other and keep each other accountable
                        while striving towards a collective goal together.

                            UI.</span>
                        I wanted to convey a sense of progress to users and designed the elements to spring forward and
                        fill out the data element to feel like a map marker plotting a route and give a sense of the
                        distance covered towards their goals.

                    <p>
                        During this project I learned and used new research methods like conducting cultural probes and
                        creating informance videos. From gathering and analyzing the data gathered I gained a lot of
                        experience in pinpointing key needs to design for that are in line with users' values and
                        goals. I also became adept at representing my findings to share with others in weekly critiques
                        through different mediums like print and video. I know being able to articulate and share my
                        findings and design process in so many forms will be a great asset in future collaborative
                        projects.
