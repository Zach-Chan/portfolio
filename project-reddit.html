                        In a 2 week process, my team and I conducted a usability evaluation of the major social and news
                        aggregation website, Reddit but with a focus on assessing designing new user experiences that
                        would
                        improve the site’s ethical design practices.

                </div>
                <div class="full-span">
                    <p>
                        In previous evaluation projects Nielson’s Heuristics were used to evaluate usability on a rating
                        scale ranging from 0-5. However, it was clear that this would not be effective for evaluating
                        ethical design because we had identified several common dimensions of ethical taboos and still
                        required a severity scale.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This prompted us to create a new scale that focuses on (A) User Wellbeing, (B) Societal Change,
                        and (C) Inclusion/Accessibility. Each of these are rated with a severity ranking ranging from 1
                        - 3, 3 being the most severe meaning that this digital experience has pronounced real-world
                        affects. This allowed us to be quick and more in detailed with our assessment by rating things
                        like lack of screen-reader optimization a C2.

                    <p>
                        We identified 3 key insights:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            “The Abyss”: Reddit’s design easily stretches users’ time from minutes into hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Blank Slate”: Reddit’s focus is to share content online but lacks the tools to make
                            this shared content accessible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Bubbles and Bullshit”: subreddit communities are great places to interact with others
                            with
                            common interests but can also be breeding grounds for conspiracies, targeted hate, and
                            disinformation.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This lead us to focus on three main areas of improvement: Managing Use, Urging Inclusivity, and
                        Bringing Balance. We created “How might we…?” questions to guide our approaches to these
                        problems. With our focus areas and questions prompts, we all explored and rapidly sketched ideas
                        to present to each other for critique and choose the design solutions to pursue further as a
                        team.

                        In our ideation process we found lots of overlapping ideas and found several concepts with
                        potential to tackle the problems we identified. After defining the concepts and each concept’s
                        goals more clearly, we also created two rough personas, “The Struggling Student” and “The
                        Introvert Office Redditor” to strengthen our empathy for the users that would be interacting
                        with our UI designs.

                        In this area we asked “how might we encourage users to better moderate their time on Reddit? We
                        designed a time tracker feature as well as a more in depth recount of user activity. These
                        solutions aimed to limit users’ time on the site as well as inform users of how their time is
                        spent. With the tools to reflect and the tools to set more limits or regimented time on the
                        website, users can be more aware of how they spend their time on the site and have more control
                        over how much time they spend there.

                        radical thought on the platform?” We designed a Fact Checker feature to help add distinguishing
                        tags to posts to highlight reputable information as well as a concept we call the “Day-Maker
                        Award” that recognizes and brings attention to the less-noticed kind actions done every day and
                        encourages others to look for opportunities to make positive impacts in others’ lives as well.

                        Across several of our solutions we realized that Reddit affords lots of amazing, insightful
                        discussion because of its anonymity but the anonymity of Reddit and lots of online platforms
                        also can encourage destructive and toxic behaviour. Lessening that anonymity through methods
                        like a stronger footprint of a users’ time on the site and stronger recognition for positive
                        interactions could be ways to encourage more responsible usage.
